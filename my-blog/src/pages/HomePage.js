Technology changes in a flick and so does the word written to describe it. Hence, blogging in general and technical blogging, in particular, has pronounced importance in contemporary swift-moving times. The advantages that blogging offers an individual cover a wide arena including aspects such as personal growth and the professional upper hand.

    It is no wonder, with writing comes clarity. You can have a world of ambiguous ideas and knowledge inside your head that never went through scrutiny and rectification, so consuming more of it just hazes the picture even more. While you produce through writing, you have the ideas before you in form of words that you can go through, check, and update anytime. Additionally, when you take up a new arena to write about, you’d eventually learn more of it in the process of writing itself. So either penning down the gained knowledge or taking up the initiative of writing about something new to you, words give you power, refinement and clarity.
